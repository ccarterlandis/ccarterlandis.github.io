Heya! I'm Carter, but you may know me as Spacefiish. I'm a [free/libre](https://www.fsf.org/about/) and [open source](https://opensource.org/docs/osd) software developer with way too many keyboard shortcuts. I enjoy any cup of coffee that's at least "okay", befriending cats, wandering around outside, and obsessing over music.

<br>

I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science, and now I do data engineering for [Gusto](https://gusto.com) (we're hiring!). Some of my technical interests & areas of expertise include data engineering & data science, networking and server administration, shell scripting and automation, building useful developer experiences, and (get ready for this one) writing thoughtful documentation. Basically, the more time I get to spend in my terminal, the better.

<br>

I know there's not much on here right now, but if you want to chat, debate, or just have a friendly conversation, feel free to shoot me an email. Thanks for stopping by, and don't forget to be kind today.
