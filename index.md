Hi! I'm Carter Landis.

<br>

I'm a [free/libre](https://www.fsf.org/about/) and [open source](https://opensource.org/docs/osd) software (FOSS) developer interested in data science, cloud technologies, and just having way too many keyboard shortcuts.
When I'm not at my computer, I enjoy being outside, reading, and finding new music (my most current obsession is Men I Trust's 2019 album _Oncle Jazz_).

<br>

Right now, I'm working on [Augur](https://github.com/chaoss/augur), a software plaform for gathering structured trace data about FOSS ecosystems. I also lead the [Evolution Metrics Working Group](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution), which is focused on developing metrics to measure and analyze the lifecycles of FOSS projects. Both projects are Community Health Analytics Open Source Software ([CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community)) projects. CHAOSS is a Linux Foundation project focused on creating metrics and software to help define FOSS community health.
