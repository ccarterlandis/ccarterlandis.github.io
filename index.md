Hi! I'm Carter Landis. I'm a 3rd year computer science student and open source developer interested in digital privacy, data science, cloud computing, and just having way too many keyboard shortcuts.

Right now, I'm working on [Augur](https://github.com/chaoss/augur), a Python library and API for gathering and synthesizing structured data about the open source ecosystem. I'm also the lead maintainer for the [Evolution Working Group](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution), both of which are Community Health Analytics Open Source Software ([CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community)) projects. CHAOSS is a Linux Foundation project focused on creating metrics and software to help define FOSS community health.
