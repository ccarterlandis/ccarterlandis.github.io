Hi! I'm Carter Landis.

I'm a [free](https://www.fsf.org/about/) (as in free speech, not free beer) and [open source](https://opensource.org/docs/osd) (FOSS) software developer interested in data science, cloud computing, and just having way too many keyboard shortcuts.
When I'm not at my computer, I enjoy being outside, reading, and finding new music (my current obsession is Tame Impala's _The Slow Rush_).

Right now, I'm working on [Augur](https://github.com/chaoss/augur), a software plaform for gathering structured trace data about FOSS ecosystems. I also lead the [Evolution Working Group](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution), a FOSS metrics working group focused on the lifecycle of open source projects. Both projects are Community Health Analytics Open Source Software ([CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community)) projects. CHAOSS is a Linux Foundation project focused on creating metrics and software to help define FOSS community health.


While I don't have a lot about myself online, my inbox is always open to any who want to chat, debate, or just have a friendly conversation, especially if you have new music to recommend!
